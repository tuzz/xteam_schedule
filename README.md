# Introduction

xTeam Schedule is a gem that provides full control over schedules for use with [adnX's xTeam](http://www.adnx.com/i/apps/xteam4mac) software.

It is capable of reading and writing schedules, whilst providing access to all of its components through the [ActiveRecord](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html) interface, which every Ruby on Rails developer will be familiar with. This is absolutely, **the best solution** for managing agile teams.

### Features:

* **Read and write schedules** and interact with in-memory models through the ActiveRecord interface
* **Customise everything**; resources, assignments, groups, holidays, absences, iPhone sync settings..
* **Intuitive naming** of models, that correspond to what you see on screen
* **Full test coverage**, giving confidence to highly dynamic businesses everywhere

### Disclaimer

I am in no way associated with adnX. I work for an agile development company that makes use of xTeam. This project is open-source.

# Getting started

It is not required that you have [xTeam](http://www.adnx.com/i/apps/xteam4mac) installed. However, you will not be able to visualise your schedules otherwise.

**Install the gem:**

    gem install xteam_schedule

**Require it in your project:**

    require 'xteam_schedule'

..... MORE TO COME, THIS GEM IS NOT LIVE YET .....
